# Build-a-Google-Meet-clone-from-scratch-WebRTC-Socket-io-JavaScript

This project is a simple Google Meet clone built from scratch using WebRTC for real-time communication, Socket.io for signaling, and JavaScript for the frontend and backend.

## Features

- Real-time video/audio communication between multiple users
- Text chat functionality
- User authentication (optional)
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Technologies Used

- **WebRTC**: A free, open-source project that provides browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication capabilities via simple application programming interfaces (APIs).
- **Socket.io**: A JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
- **JavaScript**: A lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. It is primarily known for its use in web development.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd repo_name
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. **Open the application in your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

- Upon opening the application, users can choose to either create a new meeting or join an existing one.
- If creating a new meeting, a unique meeting ID will be generated and displayed. Share this ID with others to join the meeting.
- If joining an existing meeting, enter the meeting ID provided by the meeting creator and click "Join Meeting".
- Once in the meeting, users can enable/disable their video and audio, send text messages via the chat interface, and interact with other participants in real-time.
